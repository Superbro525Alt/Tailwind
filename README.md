## Usage

### Window
``tailwindall.window``

```python
class Window:
    
    def __init__(self, style, name, options={}):

    def main_loop(self):

    def add_widget(self, widget: any, options={}):
        
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        
    def quit(self):

    def add_on_exit_function(self, func):

    def remove_on_exit_function(self, func):

    def add_garbage_collect_path(self, path):

    def remove_garbage_collect_path(self, path):
```

#### `def __init__(style, name, options)`
You pass in a style (can be file or a string)
If you choose to pass in a file use `style = "path/to/file"`

The file and string must be in the format 
```css
.class-name {key:value;key2:value2;}
tag {key:value;key2:value2;}
```
#### `def main_loop()`
Runs the main loop. Any code after this will not be executed. Use `add_on_exit_function(func)` to add a function to be called when the window is closed.

#### `def add_widget(widget: any, options={})`
Use the function to add a widget to the window, a base options file will be as follows:
```json
{
  "place": {
    "relx": 0,
    "rely": 0,
    "anchor": util.CenterAnchor().get_anchor()
  }
}
```
Keep in mind you will have to import `tailwindall.util` and `tailwindall.widgets`

#### `def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs)`
Returns the `window._ctk` private attribute. This is only for the backend but you may use it for creating your own widgets with `tailwindall.widget.Widget()`

#### `def quit(self)`
Does garbage collection of files created when graphs are rendered. Add your own files to this list using `add_garbage_collect_path(self, path)`to add a path to the garbage collection

#### `def add_on_exit_function(self, func)`
Adds an on exit function to the list, this function will be called on the closing of the window.

#### `def remove_on_exit_function(self, func)`
Removes an on exit function from the list <ins>NOT RECOMMENDED</ins>

#### `def add_garbage_collect_path(self, path)`
Add your own garbage collection path to be deleted on window close

#### `def remove_garbage_collect_path(self, path)`
Remove garbage collect path <ins>NOT RECOMMENDED</ins>

### Graphing
`tailwindall.graphing`

These are the acceptable types of graphs to be put in the ```GraphOptions.type``` parameter.
#### Graph Options
```python

Graph options take in:
- `xLabel` (a label for the x axis)

- `size` a `util.ImageScale` object
- `type` a string containing the type of graph. Must be in `GRAPH_TYPES`

## Util
`tailwindall.util`

### Constants
```python
NULL = None
null = NULL
```
These are used to create a more diverse usage of null types.

### Type Utilities
`tailwindall.util.Types`


#### `def are_list_items_same(cls, this: list, other: list):`
<ins>`@classmethod`</ins>

Can be called using `tailwindall.util.Types.are_list_items_same(this, other)` depending on how you import it. You pass in two lists and the function will return a list telling you if the item in the same index in each list are the same type.

#### `def is_class_same(cls, this: object, other: object):`
<ins>`@classmethod`</ins>

Can be called using `tailwindall.util.Types.is_class_same`. It takes in two objects and outputs wheather each attribute in each object is the same and if it is not in the other object it outputs `None`. The return value is a dictionary containing all the attribute names from each object as keys and if the are the same between objects as the value. 

#### `def is_type(cls, this, other):`
<ins>`@classmethod`</ins>

Can be called using `tailwindall.util.Types.is_type`. Takes in two arguments `this` and `other`and returns weather they are the same object type.

### File Utilities
`tailwindall.util`

`def read_file(file, options={}):`

Reads a file and returns contents. `options` allow for the user to input `{"strip": True}` to strip the lines before returning and `{"lines": True}`to return the value of readlines.

The only other argument is `file` which is the path to the file that you are trying to read.

### Anchor Points
`tailwindall.util`

#### General

To access the anchor for use with placing widgets use `anchor_class.get_anchor()`. `get_anchor()` is a class method allowing it to be called without it's respective object needing to be instantiated.

#### Current Types
The current anchors are as follows:

- `EmptyAnchor`
- `CenterAnchor`
- `NorthAnchor`
- `NorthEastAnchor`
- `EastAnchor`
- `SouthEastAnchor`
- `SouthAnchor`
- `WestAnchor`
- `NorthWestAnchor`

### Image Scale
`tailwindall.util.ImageScale(width, height)`

Takes in a width and a height and returns it when called (`image_scale()`)

### Other

#### Execute List
`tailwindall.util.exec_list(functions, final=None):`

Takes in a list of functions and a final function to be called (_not required_)

It executes each function in the list before finishing with the final function.
