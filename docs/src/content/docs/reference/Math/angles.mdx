This module provides a set of functions for working with angles.

## Usage

To import this module, use the following code:

```python
import tailwindall.maths_lib.angles as angles
```

### Get angle from lines

This function returns the angle between two lines.

```python
import tailwindall.maths_lib.angles as angles

line1 = ((0, 0), (1, 1))

line2 = ((0, 0), (1, 0))

angles.get_angle_from_lines(line1, line2)
```

Line 1 is the line that the angle is measured from, and line 2 is the line that the angle is measured to.

The arguments are of type `tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]`, where the first tuple is the start point of the line, and the second tuple is the end point of the line.

The function returns the angle in degrees as a `float`.

### Does diagonal bisect

This function returns whether a diagonal bisects a rectangle.

```python
import tailwindall.maths_lib.angles as angles

midpoint = (0, 0)

diagonal = [(0, 0), (1, 1)]

angles.does_diagonal_bisect(midpoint, diagonal)
```

The midpoint is the point that the diagonal bisects, and the diagonal is the diagonal that is being tested.

The arguments are of type `tuple[int, int]` for the midpoint, and `tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]` for the diagonal.

The function returns a `bool` indicating whether the diagonal bisects the rectangle.
