The module allows you to find the length of liens on a cartesian plane and weather 2 lines intersect.

## Usage

To import the `lines` module, add the following line to the top of your code:

```python
import tailwindall.maths_lib.lines as lines
```

### Calculating the length of a line

To calculate the length of a line, use the `length` function:

```python
import tailwindall.maths_lib.lines as lines

line = [[0, 0], [3, 4]]

length = lines.length(line)
```

A line is represented as a list of 2 points, each point is a list of 2 numbers, the x and y coordinates.

### Checking if 2 lines intersect

To check if 2 lines intersect, use the `intersect` function:

```python
import tailwindall.maths_lib.lines as lines

line1 = [[0, 0], [3, 4]]

line2 = [[0, 4], [3, 0]]

intersect = lines.line_intersection(line1, line2)
```

A line is represented as a list of 2 points, each point is a list of 2 numbers, the x and y coordinates.
